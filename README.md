# Choose Your Fighter – HTML/CSS Form

This is a simple HTML and CSS project where the user selects their favorite Mortal Kombat character using radio buttons. 
It's a basic form layout with a touch of styling — built as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
There currently is no backend or anything, so when you hit `submit` nothing will really happen other then you getting an error, but I am working on that!

## 🔧 What It Does

- Presents a list of characters (Subzero, Scorpion, Jax, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Kitana)
- Lets you select one fighter using radio buttons
- Submits the form (no backend — URL updates with selected character)
- Includes basic dark theme styling using CSS

## 🎮 Screenshot

*Coming soon!*, Once I do a little more styling and build a backend.
